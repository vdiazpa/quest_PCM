# Input Data Structure

QuESt PCM reads system input data from CSV files. To ensure the inputs are parsed correctly, the data directory must follow a specific structure, shown below. Click the options to see details on how to populate each CSV file. The file organization is largely based on the RTS-GMLC input data format (see the [RTS_GMLC](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC/) repository for details).

## `penalties.csv`
<a id="penalties"></a>

This CSV file specifies the penalty prices applied to system load curtailment and ancillary service shortfalls. The load curtailment penalty must always be set higher than all other penalties. In addition, a penalty for contingency transmission line flow violations must also be provided.

[Back to Top](#top)
## `load_timeseries/`
<a id="load_timeseries"></a>

This folder contains two CSV files.
`load_timeseries_DA.csv` provides the forecasted day-ahead power demand, while `load_timeseries_RT.csv`contains the actual power demand at 5-minute intervals. Demand values are organized by columns, and users may choose one of two formats:
1. Area-based: Columns correspond to region names listed in the Area column of [bus.csv](#bus)
2. Nodal-based: Columns correspond to individual Bus IDs from [bus.csv](#bus)

In the configuration YAML file, set the `load_timeseries_aggregation_level` parameter to either `area` or `node` to match the chosen format.

## `renewables_timeseries/`
<a id="ren_timeseries"></a>

This folder contains two CSV files.
`renewables_timeseries_DA.csv` provides the forecasted day-ahead capacity of renewable energy resources (RER), while `renewables_timeseries_RT.csv` contains the actual avalable RER capacitites. Data must be provided for all generators whose `Unit Type` in [gen.csv](#gen) is listed under `renewable_types` or `fixed_renewable_types` in the YAML configuration. Each CSV is organized by columns, where each column corresponds to a generator and is labeled using its `Gen UID`.

## `reserves/`
<a id="reserves"></a>
Currently, several reserve products can be included in QuEST PCM: `System reserve`, `Regulation Up`, `Regulation Down`, `Spinning Reserve`, `NonSpinning Reserve`, `Supplemental Reserve`, `
Flexible Ramp Up`, and `Flexible Ramp Down`. For these reserves, within the configuration YAML file, users are prompted to select reserve activation options as follows:
1. `None`: The reserve is not active.
2. `Fixed`: Fixed value of reserve requirement dervied from [DA_reserves_fixed_percentage.csv](#DA_reserve_default) and [RT_reserves_fixed_percentage.csv](#RT_reserve_default.csv) are used.
3. `Percentage`: User provided percentage of demand from [DA_reserves_fixed_percentage.csv](#DA_reserve_default) and [RT_reserves_fixed_percentage.csv](#RT_reserve_default.csv) are assigned as reserve requirement.
4. `Timeseries`: User provides timeseries reserve requirements in the [reserves_timeseries](#reserves_timeseries) folder.


### `DA_reserves_fixed_percentage.csv`
<a id="DA_reserve_default"></a>

| Column                   | Description                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reserve Type                  | Type of reserve. Must be among: `System reserve`, `Regulation Up`, `Regulation Down`, `Spinning Reserve`, `NonSpinning Reserve`, `Supplemental Reserve`, `Flexible Ramp Up`, and `Flexible Ramp Down`.   |
| System Fixed Requirement MW                 | Constant system wide requirement for corresponding reserve type. Activated if `fixed` option is selected for this reserve type in the configuration file                                                |
| System Percentage Requirement                 | Required reserve as a percentage of total system demand. Activated when `percentage` option is selected in the configuration file|
| Area Fixed Requirement MW                 | Constant area wide requirement for corresponding reserve type. Activated if `fixed` option is selected for this reserve type in the configuration file                                                |
| Area Percentage Requirement                 | Required reserve as a percentage of regional system demand. Activated when `percentage` option is selected in the configuration file|
| Eligible Areas                 | Specifies the areas where fixed or percentage reserve requirements should be applied |
| Remarks| Brief description of the reserve |

### `RT_reserves_fixed_percentage.csv`
<a id="RT_reserve_default"></a>

This CSV file is formatted the exact same way as the [DA_reserves_fixed_percentage.csv](#DA_reserves_default) file. One key distinction is that the `System Reserve` is not allocated in the real-time economic dispatch.

### `reserve_deployment.csv`
<a id="reserves_deployment"></a>

QuESt PCM also allows users to model reserve deployments and evaluate their impacts on generator revenues, storage revenues, and storage state of charge. This CSV file is used to specify time-series values for reserve deployments.

For regulation up and regulation down reserves, users must provide the fraction of the procured regulation capacity that was actually deployed in real time. For spinning, non-spinning, and supplemental reserves, users must specify the duration (in minutes) for which the reserves were actually deployed. Within this [test CSV file](../Data/5bus/reserves/reserve_deployment.csv), we have included reserve deployment data derived from CAISO and PJM markets for regulation up, down, and spinning reserves.

### `reserves_timeseries/`
<a id="reserves_timeseries"></a>

This folder contains timeseries CSV files for reserve requirements. For any reserve type configured with the `Timeseries` option in the YAML file, QuESt PCM reads the corresponding timeseries CSV from this folder.

Each reserve timeseries file must follow the naming convention:

* Reserve Type_timeseries_DA.csv for day-ahead reserves, where reserve type must be among: `System reserve`, `Regulation Up`, `Regulation Down`, `Spinning Reserve`, `NonSpinning Reserve`, `Supplemental Reserve`, `Flexible Ramp Up`, and `Flexible Ramp Down`.   

* Reserve Type_timeseries_RT.csv for real-time reserves

Within each CSV, reserve requirements are specified by columns. System-wide reserves must use the column name `System`. Area-specific reserves must use column names in the form `Area <AreaName>`, where `<AreaName>` matches the area name defined in [bus.csv](#bus).

## `storage/`
<a id="storage"></a>

Currently, QuESt PCM supports three storage system models: generic, battery, and pumped hydro. The generic storage model represents a conventional storage system that does not participate in ancillary service markets. In contrast, the battery and pumped hydro models incorporate technology-specific operational constraints and explicitly model participation in ancillary service markets.

Details on how to populate the input data for each of these three storage models are provided below.
